              We believe that our NFT Realtors deserve the best and that’s is
              why we will give back A LOT For example, when we reach 30% minted
              NFT’s we will Airdrop 25 NFT Realtor Licenses. The holders of
              these licenses will get 50% of the royalties from secondary sales!
              Royalties will be set at 3% for secondary sales. We will announce
              many more during and after launch. So again, stay tuned and join
              our Discord channel.
            </p>

              We give back to the community who isn’t that lucky. We’ll give a
              homeless mother/father with children a 1-year rent + gift card for
              food. 2 holders will get their NFT in an artwork done by Richard
              Hutchins (Homeless Artist) and many more.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have a lot of interesting additional benefits & giveaways
              prepared for our members, that will be unlocked through roadmap
              activations and future phases.
